Difference between malloc() and calloc() in C


malloc()


malloc() is a function that creates one block of memory of a fixed size.

malloc() only takes one argument

malloc() is faster than calloc.

malloc() has high time efficiency

malloc() is used to indicate memory allocation

Syntax : void* malloc(size_t size);

malloc() does not initialize the memory to zero

malloc() does not add any extra memory overhead




calloc()

calloc() is a function that assigns a specified number of blocks of memory to a single variable.

calloc() takes two arguments.

calloc() is slower than malloc()

calloc() has low time efficiency

calloc() is used to indicate contiguous memory allocation

Syntax : void* calloc(size_t num, size_t size);

calloc() initializes the memory to zero

calloc() adds some extra memory overhead
