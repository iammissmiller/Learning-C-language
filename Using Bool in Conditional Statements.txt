Using Bool in Conditional Statements

The bool data type is commonly used in conditional statements such as if-else statements. Condition like if a is greater than equal to b or else b is greater than a can be implemented using boolean. These conditions using conditional operator like “==” , “>” , <” , “!=” ,etc return boolean values.


Below is the implementation of conditional statements:



// C Program to implement
// conditional statements
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Main Function
int main()
{

	// Integers declared
	int a = 3;
	int b = 4;

	// Conditional Statements
	if (a > b) {
		printf("a is greater\n");
	}
	else {
		printf("a is smaller\n");
	}

	printf("%d is the result of a>b", a > b);

	return 0;
}
