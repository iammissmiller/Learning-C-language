# Variables

# Rules for Naming Variables in C

* A variable name must only contain alphabets, digits, and underscore.

* A variable name must start with an alphabet or an underscore only. It cannot start with a digit.

* No whitespace is allowed within the variable name.

* A variable name must not be any reserved word or keyword.


# C Variable Types

* Local Variables

* Global Variables

* Static Variables

* Automatic Variables

* Extern Variables

* Register Variables


1. Local Variables in C

A Local variable in C is a variable that is declared inside a function or a block of code. Its scope is limited to the block or function in which it is declared.


Example of Local Variable in C

// C program to declare and print local variable inside a
// function.
#include <stdio.h>

void function()
{
    int x = 10; // local variable
    printf("%d", x);
}

int main() { function(); }



In the above code, x can be used only in the scope of function(). Using it in the main function will give an error.


2. Global Variables in C

A Global variable in C is a variable that is declared outside the function or a block of code. Its scope is the whole program i.e. we can access the global variable anywhere in the C program after it is declared.

Example of Global Variable in C

// C program to demonstrate use of global variable
#include <stdio.h>

int x = 20; // global variable

void function1() { printf("Function 1: %d\n", x); }

void function2() { printf("Function 2: %d\n", x); }

int main()
{

    function1();
    function2();
    return 0;
}
