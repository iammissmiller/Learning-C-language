There are a few issues in your program:



Extra newline in scanf: 

When reading a string with scanf, the format specifier "%s" should not be followed by a newline character. Also, when reading a full sentence with spaces, the format specifier should be "%[^\n]" and not "%[^\n]s". The extra \n in scanf("%s\n", str); should be removed, as it can cause unexpected behavior.



Mixing input methods: 

Using scanf for string input and then using it again to read a sentence can cause issues because of how scanf handles newline characters left in the input buffer. After reading a word with scanf, there might be a leftover newline in the buffer that needs to be handled before reading a full sentence.



Flushing input buffer: 

The program should clear the input buffer before reading the sentence, especially when switching from reading a word to reading a sentence.


Key Changes:


Removed the newline in the first scanf format string.


Added getchar() to consume the leftover newline character after the first scanf.

Corrected the format specifier for the sentence to "%[^\n]" to properly read the full sentence.
