Subtraction of Two Pointers

The subtraction of two pointers is possible only when they have the same data type. The result is 
generated by calculating the difference between the addresses of the two pointers and calculating 
how many bits of data it is according to the pointer data type. The subtraction of two pointers gives
the increments between the two pointers. 

For Example: 
Two integer pointers say ptr1(address:1000) and ptr2(address:1004) are subtracted. The difference 
between addresses is 4 bytes. Since the size of int is 4 bytes, therefore the increment between ptr1
and ptr2 is given by (4/4) = 1.

Example of Subtraction of Two Pointer

// C program to illustrate pointer Subtraction
#include <stdio.h>

// Driver Code
int main()
{
    // Integer variable
    int N = 4;

    // Pointer to an integer
    int *ptr1, *ptr2;

    // Pointer stores the address of N
    ptr1 = &N;
    ptr2 = &N;

    printf("Pointer ptr2 before Subtraction: ");
    printf("%p \n", ptr2);

    // Subtraction of 3 to ptr2
    ptr2 = ptr2 - 3;
    printf("Pointer ptr2 after Subtraction: ");
    printf("%p \n", ptr2);

    return 0;
}
