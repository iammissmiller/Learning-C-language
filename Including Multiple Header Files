Including Multiple Header Files

You can use various header files in a program. When a header file is included twice within a program, the compiler processes the contents of that header file twice. This leads to an error in the program. To eliminate this error, conditional preprocessor directives are used.

Syntax

#ifndef HEADER_FILE_NAME
#define HEADER_FILE_NAME
the entire header file
#endif

This construct is called wrapper “#ifndef”. When the header is included again, the conditional will become false, because HEADER_FILE_NAME is defined. The preprocessor will skip over the entire file contents, and the compiler will not see it twice.

Sometimes it’s essential to include several diverse header files based on the requirements of the program. For this, multiple conditionals are used.

Syntax

#if SYSTEM_ONE
        #include "system1.h"
#elif SYSTEM_TWO
        #include "system2.h"
#elif SYSTEM_THREE
        ....
#endif
