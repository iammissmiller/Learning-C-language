Function-Like Macros

These macros are the same as a function call. It replaces the entire code instead of a function name. Pair of parentheses immediately after the macro name is necessary. If we put a space between the macro name and the parentheses in the macro definition, then the macro will not work. 
A function-like macro is only lengthened if and only if its name appears with a pair of parentheses after it. If we donâ€™t do this, the function pointer will get the address of the real function and lead to a syntax error.

Example

The below example is the illustration of function-like macros

// C program to illustrate macros
#include <stdio.h>

// Function-like Macro definition
#define min(a, b) (((a) < (b)) ? (a) : (b))

// Driver Code
int main()
{

    // Given two number a and b
    int a = 18;
    int b = 76;

    printf("Minimum value between"
           " %d and %d is %d\n",
           a, b, min(a, b));

    return 0;
}

Output
Minimum value between 18 and 76 is 18
Here is one example that will give more understanding of Macros:
