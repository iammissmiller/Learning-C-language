Using Range in switch Case in C


You all are familiar with switch case in C, but did you know you can use a range of numbers instead of a single number or character in the case statement? Range in switch case can be useful when we want to run the same set of statements for a range of numbers so that we do not have to write cases separately for each value.

That is the case range extension of the GNU C compiler and not standard C.
You can specify a range of consecutive values in a single case label.
Syntax
The syntax for using range case is:

case low ... high:
It can be used for a range of ASCII character codes like this:

case 'A' ... 'Z':
You need to Write spaces around the ellipses ( … ). For example, write this:

// Correct  -   case 1 ... 5: 
// Wrong -    case 1...5: 


# Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of array arr.

Auxiliary Space: O(1)


# Error conditions

low > high: The compiler gives an error message.

Overlapping case values: If the value of a case label is within a case range that has already been used in the switch statement, the compiler gives an error message.
