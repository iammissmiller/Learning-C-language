Comparison to NULL

A pointer can be compared or assigned a NULL value irrespective of what is the pointer type. 
Such pointers are called NULL pointers and are used in various pointer-related error-handling methods.
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int* ptr = NULL;

    if (ptr == NULL) {
    printf("The pointer is NULL");
    }
    else {
        printf("The pointer is not NULL");
    }
    return 0;
}
