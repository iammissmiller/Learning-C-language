Addition of Integer to Pointer

When a pointer is added with an integer value, the value is first multiplied by the size of the data type and then 
added to the pointer.

For Example:
Consider the same example as above where the ptr is an integer pointer that stores 1000 as an address. If we add
integer 5 to it using the expression, ptr = ptr + 5, then, the final address stored in the ptr will be
ptr = 1000 + sizeof(int) * 5 = 1020.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    
    int n = 4;
    
    int *p , *q ;
    
    p = &n;
    
    q = &n;
    
    printf("before addition p = %p" , p);
    
    p = p + 3;
    
    printf("\nafter addition p = %p" , p);
    
    return 0;
    
}
