What are the data types for which it is not possible to create an array?

In C, it is possible to have array of all types except following.
1) void.
2) functions.

For example, below program throws compiler error

int main()
{
    void arr[100];
}
Output:

error: declaration of 'arr' as array of voids 
But we can have array of void pointers and function pointers. The below program works fine.

int main()
{
    void *arr[100];
}
