Increment Operator

* Increment Operator adds 1 to the operand.

* The Postfix increment operator means the expression is evaluated first using the original value of the variable and then the variable is incremented(increased).The 

* Prefix increment operator means the variable is incremented first and then the expression is evaluated using the new value of the variable.

* Generally, we use this in decision-making and looping.



Decrement Operator

* Decrement Operator subtracts 1 from the operand.

* The Postfix decrement operator means the expression is evaluated first using the original value of the variable and then the variable is decremented(decreased).

* Prefix decrement operator means the variable is decremented first and then the expression is evaluated using the new value of the variable.

* This is also used in decision-making and looping.
