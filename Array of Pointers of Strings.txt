Array of Pointers of Strings

In C we can use an Array of pointers. Instead of having a 2-Dimensional character array, we can have a single-dimensional array of Pointers. Here pointer to the first character of the string literal is stored.

Syntax:

char *arr[] = { "Geek", "Geeks", "Geekfor" };


#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

char *arr[] = {"hello" , "praptee" , "miller"};

printf("string array elements are :\n");

for (int i = 0; i < 3 ; i++) {
printf("%s\n" , arr[i]);
}

return 0;

}
