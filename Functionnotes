Function 

set of statements when called perform some specific task

basic building block of programme 

used for code reusability 


# syntax if functions 

1. Declaration 
2. Definition 
3. calling 

#function declaration 

A function declaration tells the compiler that there is a function with given name defined 
some where else in programme.

We must provide function name its return type the number and type of its parameters 

Syntax 

return_type name(para1 , para2);

***a function in c must always be declared globally before calling it


#function definition 

consists actual statement 

we do not need to declare and define function explicitly 

# function call

instructs the compiler to execute the function 

we use the function name and parameters in the function call
