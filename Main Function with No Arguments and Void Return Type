1. Main Function with No Arguments and Void Return Type

Letâ€™s see the example of the main function inside which we have written a simple program for printing a string. In the below code, first, we include a header file and then we define a 
main function inside which we write a statement to print a string using printf() function. The main function is called by the operating system itself and then executes all statements 
inside this function.


Syntax

void main()
{
   // Function body
}
The above function is equivalent to:

void main (void)
{
    // Function Body
}


Example 

#include <stdio.h>

void main()

{
    
    printf("hello hell");
    
}
