Limitations of C Structures

In C language, structures provide a method for packing together data of different types. A Structure is a helpful tool to handle a group of logically related data items. However, C structures also have some limitations.

Higher Memory Consumption: It is due to structure padding.

No Data Hiding: C Structures do not permit data hiding. Structure members can be accessed by any function, anywhere in the scope of the structure.

Functions inside Structure: C structures do not permit functions inside the structure so we cannot provide the associated functions.

Static Members: C Structure cannot have static members inside its body.

Construction creation in Structure: Structures in C cannot have a constructor inside Structures.
