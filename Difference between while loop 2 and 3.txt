They differ in Operation performed inside the loop

gfg2 is updated in each iteration, but this update doesn't affect the loop condition the
loop will always remain true and gfg2 will be updated infinitely.

The primary difference is that the first programme increments the variable gfg2 in each 
iteration, while the second programme doesn't use gfg2 , both programme behave the same way 
with an infinite loop
