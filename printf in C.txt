printf in C

In C language, printf() function is used to print formatted output to the standard output stdout (which is generally the console screen).  The printf function is a part of the C standard library <stdio.h> and it can allow formatting the output in numerous ways.


Syntax of printf

printf ( "formatted_string", arguments_list);


Parameters

formatted_string: It is a string that specifies the data to be printed. It may also contain a format specifier to print the value of any variable such as a character and an integer.

Example of printf

In this example, we are printing the string “Hello Geek!” in the output using printf() function. In printf() function what we will write inside the double quotes (” “) is printed in the output.

// C program to illustrate the use of printf function
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	// using printf to print "Hello Geek!"
	printf("Hello Geek!");

	return 0;
}
