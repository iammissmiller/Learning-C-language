Comparison of Pointers

We can compare the two pointers by using the comparison operators in C. We can implement this by using all operators in C >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=.  It returns true for the valid condition and returns false for the unsatisfied condition. 

Step 1: Initialize the integer values and point these integer values to the pointer.
Step 2: Now, check the condition by using comparison or relational operators on pointer variables.
Step 3: Display the output.

Example of Pointer Comparision

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    
   int arr[5];
   
   int* p = &arr;
   
   int* q = &arr[0];
   
   if (p==q)
   
   printf("they are equal");
   
   else
   
   printf("they are not equal ");
   
   return 0;
   
}
