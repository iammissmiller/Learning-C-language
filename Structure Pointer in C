Structure Pointer in C

We can define a pointer that points to the structure like any other variable. Such pointers are generally called Structure Pointers. We can access the members of the structure pointed by the structure pointer using the ( -> ) arrow operator.

Example of Structure Pointer

// C program to illustrate the structure pointer
#include <stdio.h>

// structure declaration
struct Point {
    int x, y;
};

int main()
{
    struct Point str = { 1, 2 };

    // p2 is a pointer to structure p1
    struct Point* ptr = &str;

    // Accessing structure members using structure pointer
    printf("%d %d", ptr->x, ptr->y);

    return 0;
}

Output
1 2
