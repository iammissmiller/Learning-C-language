Implicit return type int in C


Predict the output of following C program.

#include <stdio.h> 
fun(int x) 
{ 
    return x*x; 
} 
int main(void) 
{ 
    printf("%d", fun(10)); 
    return 0; 
}

Output: 100

The important thing to note is, there is no return type for fun(), the program still compiles and runs fine in most of the C compilers. In C, if we do not specify a return type, compiler assumes an implicit return type as int. However, C99 standard doesnâ€™t allow return type to be omitted even if return type is int. This was allowed in older C standard C89.

In C++, the above program is not valid except few old C++ compilers like Turbo C++. Every function should specify the return type in C++.
