2. Main Function with No Arguments and int Return Type

In this example, we use the int return type in the main() function that indicates the exit status of the program. The exit status is a way for the program to communicate to the operating 
system whether the program was executed successfully or not. The convention is that a return value of 0 indicates that the program was completed successfully, while any other value indicates 
that an error occurred.

Syntax

int main()
{
   // Function body
}
or

int main(void)
{
    // Function Body
}



Example

#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{
    
    printf("hello hell");
    return 0;
}
