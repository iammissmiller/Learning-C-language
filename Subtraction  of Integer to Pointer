Subtraction  of Integer to Pointer

When a pointer is subtracted with an integer value, the value is first multiplied by the size 
of the data type and then subtracted from the pointer similar to addition.

For Example:
Consider the same example as above where the ptr is an integer pointer that stores 1000 as 
an address. If we subtract integer 5 from it using the expression, ptr = ptr – 5, then, the 
final address stored in the ptr will be ptr = 1000 – sizeof(int) * 5 = 980.


#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    
    int n = 4;
    
    int *p , *q ;
    
    p = &n;
    
    q = &n;
    
    printf("before addition p = %p" , p);
    
    p = p - 3;
    
    printf("\nafter addition p = %p" , p);
    
    return 0;
    
}
