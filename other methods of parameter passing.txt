Other Methods of Parameter Passing
These techniques are older and were used in earlier programming languages like Pascal, Algol, and Fortran. 
These techniques are not applicable in high-level languages.

1. Pass by Result
This method uses out-mode semantics. Just before control is transferred back to the caller, the value of the 
formal parameter is transmitted back to the actual parameter. This method is sometimes called call by the result. 
In general, the pass-by-result technique is implemented by copying.

2. Pass by Value-Result
This method uses in/out-mode semantics. It is a combination of Pass-by-Value and Pass-by-Result. Just before the 
control is transferred back to the caller, the value of the formal parameter is transmitted back to the actual 
parameter. This method is sometimes called call by value-result.

3. Pass by Name
This technique is used in programming languages such as Algol. In this technique, the symbolic “name” of a 
variable is passed, which allows it both to be accessed and updated.
