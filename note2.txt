what is wrong with my program


Your program has a minor issue with how input is handled after reading the float value and before reading the character.
 
Specifically, the issue arises because scanf() leaves a newline character ('\n') in the input buffer after reading the float, which causes scanf("%c", &ch); to immediately read this newline character instead of waiting for user input.



Here’s what’s happening:



After reading the integer and float values using scanf("%d", &num); and scanf("%f", &f);, there is still a newline character in the input buffer.


When scanf("%c", &ch); is called, it immediately reads this newline character instead of waiting for the user to input a character.


The issue can be fixed by adding another call to getchar() after reading the float value to consume the leftover newline character before reading the character input.
