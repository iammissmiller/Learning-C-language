Callbacks in C

A callback is any executable code that is passed as an argument to another code, which is expected to call back (execute) the argument at a given time. In simple language, 
If a reference of a function is passed to another function as an argument to call it, then it will be called a Callback function.

In C, a callback function is a function that is called through a function pointer.

Below is a simple example in C to illustrate the above definition to make it more clear.

#include <stdio.h>

void A() {
    printf("I am Function A\n");
}

void B(void (*ptr)())
{
    
    (*ptr) ();
    
}

int main()
{
    
    void (*ptr)() =&A;
    B(ptr);
    
    return 0;
    
}

In C++ STL, functors are also used for this purpose.
