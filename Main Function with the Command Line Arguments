3. Main Function with the Command Line Arguments

In this example, we have passed some arguments in the main() function as seen in the below code. These arguments are called command line arguments and these are given at the time of 
executing a program.

The first argument argc means argument count which means it stores the number of arguments passed in the command line and by default, its value is 1 when no argument is passed.

The second argument is a char pointer array argv[] which stores all the command line arguments passed. We can also see in the output when we run the program without passing any command 
line argument the value of argc is 1.

Syntax

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
   // Function body
}


Example

// C Program to illustrate the main function with command line arguments
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv)
{

	// printing the coundt of arguments
	printf("The value of argc is %d\n", argc);
	// prining each argument
	for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
		printf("%s \n", argv[i]);
	}

	return 0;
}
