Array of Characters (Strings)

In C, we store the words, i.e., a sequence of characters in the form of an array of characters 
terminated by a NULL character. These are called strings in C language.

// C Program to illustrate strings
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

    // creating array of character
    char arr[6] = { 'G', 'e', 'e', 'k', 's', '\0' };

    // printing string
    int i = 0;
    while (arr[i]) {
        printf("%c", arr[i++]);
    }
    return 0;
}
