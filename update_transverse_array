Update Array Element
We can update the value of an element at the given index i in a similar way to accessing an 
element by using the array subscript operator [ ] and assignment operator =.

array_name[i] = new_value;
C Array Traversal
Traversal is the process in which we visit every element of the data structure. For C array 
traversal, we use loops to iterate through each element of the array.

Array Traversal using for Loop
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    array_name[i];
}
