Uses of Pointers in C
The C pointer is a very powerful tool that is widely used in C programming to perform various useful 
operations. It is used to achieve the following functionalities in C:

Pass Arguments by Reference
Accessing Array Elements
Return Multiple Values from Function
Dynamic Memory Allocation
Implementing Data Structures
In System-Level Programming where memory addresses are useful.
In locating the exact value at some memory location.
To avoid compiler confusion for the same variable name.
To use in Control Tables.
Advantages of Pointers
Following are the major advantages of pointers in C:

Pointers are used for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
An Array or a structure can be accessed efficiently with pointers
Pointers are useful for accessing memory locations.
Pointers are used to form complex data structures such as linked lists, graphs, trees, etc.
Pointers reduce the length of the program and its execution time as well.
Disadvantages of Pointers
Pointers are vulnerable to errors and have following disadvantages:

Memory corruption can occur if an incorrect value is provided to pointers.
Pointers are a little bit complex to understand.
Pointers are majorly responsible for memory leaks in C.
Pointers are comparatively slower than variables in C.
Uninitialized pointers might cause a segmentation fault.
Conclusion
In conclusion, pointers in C are very capable tools and provide C language with its distinguishing 
features, such as low-level memory access, referencing, etc. But as powerful as they are, they should 
be used with responsibility as they are one of the most vulnerable parts o
