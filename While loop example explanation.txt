As we can see , even when the condition is false at the start, the loop body is executed once .

This is because in te do while loop , the condition is checked after going through the body so when the
control is at the start ,

1. It goes through the loop body .

2. Executes all the statement in the body.

3. Check the condition which turns out to be false.

4. Then exit the loop
