Data Types in C

Each variable in C has an associated data type. It specifies the type of data that the variable can store like integer, character, floating, double, etc.

Each data type requires different amounts of memory and has some specific operations which can be performed over it.

The data type is a collection of data with values having fixed values, meaning as well as its characteristics.


* Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are the most basic data types that are used for representing simple values such as integers, float, characters, etc.


* User Defined Data Types	

The user-defined data types are defined by the user himself.


* Derived Types	

The data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types.


Different data types also have different ranges up to which they can store numbers. These ranges may vary from compiler to compiler. Below is a list of ranges along with the memory requirement and format specifiers on the 32-bit GCC compiler.
