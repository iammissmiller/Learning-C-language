# Keywords Revision

# enum

* The enum keyword is used to declare an enum   (short for enumeration).
* An enum is a user-defined datatype, which   holds a list of user-defined integer   constants.
* By default, the value of each constant is   it’s index (starting at zero), though this   can be changed.
* You can declare an object of an enum and can   set it’s value to one of the constants you   declared before.

# Example 

// An example program to 
// demonstrate working of 
// enum in C
#include<stdio.h>

// enum declaration:
enum week{Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun};

// Driver code
int main()
{
//object of the enum (week), called day
  enum week day;
  day = Wed;
  printf("%d", day);
  return 0;
}



# extern

The extern keyword is used to declare a variable or a function that has an external   linkage outside of the file declaration.

# Example

#include <stdio.h>

extern int a;

int main(){ 
  
    printf("%d", a);

      return 0;
}



# for

The “for” keyword is used to declare a for-loop. A for-loop is a loop that is specified to run a certain amount of times.


# Example

// C program to demonstrate 
// for keyword
#include <stdio.h>

// Driver code
int main()
{
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
  {
    printf("%d ", i);
  }
  return 0;
}
