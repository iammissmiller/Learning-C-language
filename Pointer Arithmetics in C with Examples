Pointer Arithmetics in C with Examples

Pointer Arithmetic is the set of valid arithmetic operations that can be performed on pointers. The pointer variables store the memory address of another variable. It doesnâ€™t store any value. 

Hence, there are only a few operations that are allowed to perform on Pointers in C language. The C pointer arithmetic operations are slightly different from the ones that we generally use for mathematical calculations. These operations are:

Increment/Decrement of a Pointer
Addition of integer to a pointer
Subtraction of integer to a pointer
Subtracting two pointers of the same type
Comparison of pointers
