Relationship between Arrays and Pointers

Arrays and Pointers are closely related to each other such that we can use pointers to perform 
all the possible operations of the array. The array name is a constant pointer to the first 
element of the array and the array decays to the pointers when passed to the function.


#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{
    int arr[5] = {10 , 20 ,30 ,40 ,40 , 50};
    int* ptr = &arr[0];
    
    printf("address stored in array name : %p\naddress of 1st array elements : %p\n" , arr , arr[0]);
    
    printf("array elements using pointer : ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5 ; i++) {
        printf("%d " , *ptr++);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
