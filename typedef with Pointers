2. typedef with Pointers

typedef can also be used with pointers as it gives an alias name to the pointers. Typedef is very efficient while declaring multiple pointers in a single statement because pointers bind to the right on the simple declaration. 

Example:

typedef int* Int_ptr;
Int_ptr var, var1, var2;
In the above statement var, var1, and var2 are declared as pointers of type int which helps us to declare multiple numbers of pointers in a single statement. 

Example 2: Using typedef to define a name for pointer type.

// C program to implement
// typedef with pointers
#include <stdio.h>

typedef int* ptr;

// Driver code
int main()
{
    ptr var;
    *var = 20;

    printf("Value of var is %d", *var);
    return 0;
}

Output
Value of var is 20
