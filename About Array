Advantages of Array in C
The following are the main advantages of an array:

Random and fast access of elements using the array index.
Use of fewer lines of code as it creates a single array of multiple elements.
Traversal through the array becomes easy using a single loop.
Sorting becomes easy as it can be accomplished by writing fewer lines of code.



Disadvantages of Array in C

Allows a fixed number of elements to be entered which is decided at the time of declaration. Unlike a linked list, an array in C is not dynamic.
Insertion and deletion of elements can be costly since the elements are needed to be rearranged after insertion and deletion.


Conclusion

The array is one of the most used and important data structures in C. It is one of the core concepts of C language that is used in every other program. 
Though it is important to know about its limitation so that we can take advantage of its functionality.
