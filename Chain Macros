Chain Macros

Macros inside macros are termed chain macros. In chain macros first of all parent macro is expanded then the child macro is expanded.

Example 

The below program is the illustration of a Chain Macro

// C program to illustrate macros
#include <stdio.h>
 
// Macro definition
#define INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS
#define FOLLOWERS 138
 
// Driver Code
int main()
{
    // Print the message
    printf("Geeks for Geeks have %dK"
           " followers on Instagram",
           INSTAGRAM);
 
    return 0;
}

Output
Geeks for Geeks have 138K followers on Instagram

Explanation: 
INSTAGRAM is expanded first to produce FOLLOWERS. Then the expanded macro is expanded to produce the outcome as 138K. This is called the chaining of macros.
