Pointer Arithmetic on Arrays

Pointers contain addresses. Adding two addresses makes no sense because there is no idea what
it would point to. Subtracting two addresses lets you compute the offset between the two addresses. 
An array name acts like a pointer constant. The value of this pointer constant is the address of the first element.
