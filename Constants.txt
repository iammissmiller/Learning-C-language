Constants in C

* The constants in C are the read-only variables whose values cannot be modified once they are declared in the C program.

* The type of constant can be an integer constant, a floating pointer constant, a string constant, or a character constant. In C language, the const keyword is used to define the constants.


How to Define Constant in C?

We define a constant in C language using the const keyword. Also known as a const type qualifier, the const keyword is placed at the start of the variable declaration to declare that variable as a constant.


Syntax to Define Constant

const data_type var_name = value;

# Example

// C program to illustrate constant variable definition
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

	// defining integer constant using const keyword
	const int int_const = 25;

	// defining character constant using const keyword
	const char char_const = 'A';

	// defining float constant using const keyword
	const float float_const = 15.66;

	printf("Printing value of Integer Constant: %d\n",
		int_const);
	printf("Printing value of Character Constant: %c\n",
		char_const);
	printf("Printing value of Float Constant: %f",
		float_const);

	return 0;
}



# Types of Constants in C

* Integer Constant

* Character Constant

* Floating Point Constant

* Double Precision Floating Point Constant

* Array Constant

* Structure Constant


Properties of Constant in C

The important properties of constant variables in C defined using the const keyword are as follows:


1. Initialization with Declaration

We can only initialize the constant variable in C at the time of its declaration. Otherwise, it will store the garbage value.


2. Immutability

The constant variables in c are immutable after its definition, i.e., they can be initialized only once in the whole program. After that, we cannot modify the value stored inside that variable.




// C Program to demonstrate the behaviour of constant
// variable
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	// declaring a constant variable
	const int var;
	// initializing constant variable var after declaration
	var = 20;

	printf("Value of var: %d", var);
	return 0;
}
