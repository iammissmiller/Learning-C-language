Application of Double Pointers in C

Following are the main uses of pointer to pointers in C:

They are used in the dynamic memory allocation of multidimensional arrays.
They can be used to store multilevel data such as the text document paragraph, sentences, and word semantics.
They are used in data structures to directly manipulate the address of the nodes without copying.
They can be used as function arguments to manipulate the address stored in the local pointer.
