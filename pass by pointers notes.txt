# Pass by Pointers 

* this technique uses a pointer 

* in function we passmemory address (pointer) of a variable rather than passing the actual value of variable .

* this passing technique allows the function to accessand modify the context at that particular memory location .


# Shortcomings of pass by pointers 

* Pointers can be null so null pointers issues aries if properly not checked 

* if more than one pointers point to the same memory location then changes mode by one pointer which points to the same 
memory location 

* memory management should be done effectively using functions like malloc and free
