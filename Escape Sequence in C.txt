Escape Sequence in C 

* The escape sequence in C is the characters or the sequence of characters that can be used inside the string literal. 

* The purpose of the escape sequence is to represent the characters that cannot be used normally using the keyboard.

* Some escape sequence characters are the part of ASCII charset but some are not.

* Different escape sequences represent different characters but the output is dependent on the compiler you are using.


# Escape Sequence in C Examples

*** Alarm or Beep (\a) 

It is used to generate a bell sound in the C program.

Example to demonstrate how to use \a escape sequence in C

// C program to illustrate  \a escape sequence
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // output may depend upon the compiler
    printf("My mobile number "
           "is 7\a8\a7\a3\a9\a2\a3\a4\a0\a8\a");
    return (0);
}


*** Backspace (\b)

It is used to move the cursor one place backward.

// C program to illustrate  \b escape sequence
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // \b - backspace character transfers
    // the cursor one character back with
    // or without deleting on different
    // compilers.
    printf("Hello \b\b\b\b\b\bHi Geeks");
    return (0);
}


*** New Line (\n)

It moves the cursor to the start of the next line.

Example to demonstrate how to use \n escape sequence in C

// C program to illustrate \n escape sequence
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    // Here we are using \n, which is a new line character.
    printf("Hello\n");
    printf("GeeksforGeeks");
    return (0);
}


*** Horizontal Tab (\t)	

It inserts some whitespace to the left of the cursor and moves the cursor accordingly.

Example to demonstrate how to use \t escape sequence in C

// C program to illustrate \t escape sequence
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // Here we are using \t, which is
    // a horizontal tab character.
    // It will provide a tab space
    // between two words.
    printf("Hello \t GFG");
    return (0);
