Bit Fields

Bit Fields are used to specify the length of the structure members in bits. When we know the maximum length of the member, we can use bit fields to specify the size and reduce memory consumption.

Syntax of Bit Fields
struct structure_name {
    data_type member_name: width_of_bit-field;
};
 Example of Bit Fields

// C Program to illustrate bit fields in structures
#include <stdio.h>

// declaring structure for reference
struct str1 {
    int a;
    char c;
};

// structure with bit fields
struct str2 {
    int a : 24; // size of 'a' is 3 bytes = 24 bits
    char c;
};

// driver code
int main()
{
    printf("Size of Str1: %d\nSize of Str2: %d",
           sizeof(struct str1), sizeof(struct str2));
    return 0;
}

Output
Size of Str1: 8
Size of Str2: 4
As we can see, the size of the structure is reduced when using the bit field to define the max size of the member ‘a’.
