Size of Pointer to Pointer in C

In the C programming language, a double pointer behaves similarly to a normal pointer in C. So,
the size of the double-pointer variable is always equal to the normal pointers. We can verify 
this using the below C Program.

Example 1: C Program to find the size of a pointer to a pointer.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a = 69;
    
    int* p = &a;
    
    int** double_p = &p;
    
    printf("size of normal pointer =  %d", sizeof(p));
    
    printf("\nsize of double p = %d" , sizeof(double_p));
    
    return 0;
}

Note: The output of the above code also depends on the type of machine which is being used. The size of 
a pointer is not fixed in the C programming language and it depends on other factors like CPU architecture 
and OS used. Usually, for a 64-bit Operating System, the size will be 8 bytes and for a 32-bit Operating system, 
the size will be 4 bytes.
