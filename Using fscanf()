Using fscanf()

fscanf() is similar to scanf() that reads the input in the form of formatted string. It can take, ignore, modify the types of the variables using the scanset characters.

Syntax
int fscanf(FILE *ptr, const char *format, ...)

Program to Read a File Using fscanf()

// C Program to Read a File Using fscanf()
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *ptr = fopen("test.txt", "r");
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        printf("no such file.");
        return 0;
    }

    /* Assuming that test.txt has content
       in below format
       NAME    AGE
       Raman   12
       Kunal   25
       Vikas   65 */
    char name[100];
    int age;
    printf("Contents of the File are:\n");
    while (fscanf(ptr, "%s %d", name, &age) == 2) {
        printf("Name: %s\t   Age: %d\n", name, age);
    }

    return 0;
}

test.txt

Raman 12
Kunal 25
Vikas 65

Output

Contents of the File are:
Name: Raman   Age: 12
Name: Kunal   Age: 25
Name: Vikas   Age: 65
When to use fscan()?
Reading a file using fread() is best for structured data files, such as CSV files or files with fixed formats (e.g., reading a list of records with specific fields).
