length of array Using Pointer Arithmetic

We can also calculate the length of an array in C using pointer arithmetic. This solution 
of using a pointer is just a hack that is used to find the number of elements in an array.

Syntax:

 data_type length = *(&arr + 1) - arr;
In the above syntax:

&arr: Pointer to an array of elements.
(&arr + 1): Address of memory ahead of the array as pointer type is a pointer to an array of
integers.
*(&arr + 1) â€“ arr: Inclusive difference between the start and the end of the array

#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{
    
    int arr[] = { 1 , 2 , 3 ,4 , 4 , 5 ,6 ,6 };
    
    int length = *(&arr + 1) - arr;
    
    printf("number of elements in arr[] is :%d " , length);
    return 0;
    
}
