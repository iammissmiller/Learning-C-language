Wild pointer in C

A pointer that has not been initialized to anything (not even NULL) is known as a wild pointer. The pointer may be initialized to a non-NULL garbage value that may not be a valid address. 

Syntax

dataType *pointerName;

Example

The below example demonstrates the undefined behavior of the Wild pointer.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

int* p;

int x = 10;

printf("value pointed by 'p' is : %d" , *p);

return 0;

}
