The main function is an integral part of the programming languages such as C, C++, and Java. The main function in C is the entry point of a program where the execution of a program starts. 
It is a user-defined function that is mandatory for the execution of a program because when a C program is executed, the operating system starts executing the statements in the main() function.

Syntax of C main() Function
return_type main() {
    // Statement 1;
    // Statement 2;
    // and so on..
    return;
}

We can write the main function in many ways in C language as follows:

int main(){} or int main(void){}
main(){} or void main(){} or main(void){} or void main(void){}
In the above notations, int means integer return type, and void return type means that does not return any information, or (void) or () means that does not take any information.

Important Points about C main Function

It is the function where the program’s execution starts.

Every program has exactly one main function.

The name of this function should be “main” not anything else.

The main function always returns an integer value or void.

The main function is called by OS, not the user.
