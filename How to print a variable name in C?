How to print and store a variable name in string variable?

We strongly recommend you to minimize your browser and try this yourself first

In C, there’s a # directive, also called ‘Stringizing Operator’, which does this magic. Basically # directive converts its argument in a string.

#include <stdio.h> 
#define getName(var) #var 

int main() 
{ 
	int myVar; 
	printf("%s", getName(myVar)); 
	return 0; 
} 

Output:
myVar

We can also store variable name in a string using sprintf() in C.


# include <stdio.h> 
# define getName(var, str) sprintf(str, "%s", #var) 

int main() 
{ 
	int myVar; 
	char str[20]; 
	getName(myVar, str); 
	printf("%s", str); 
	return 0; 
} 

Output:
myVar
