Strings and Pointers in C

In Arrays, the variable name points to the address of 
the first element.

Below is the memory representation of the string 
str = “Geeks”.

memory representation of strings

Similar to arrays, In C, we can create a character 
pointer to a string that points to the starting address
of the string which is the first character of the string. 
The string can be accessed with the help of pointers as 
shown in the below example. 

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    
    char str[40] = "i am miller";
    
    char* ptr = str;
    
    while (*ptr != '\0') {
        printf("%c" , *ptr);
        
        ptr++;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
