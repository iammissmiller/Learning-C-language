Enum vs Macro 

We can also use macros to define names constants. For example we can define ‘Working’ and ‘Failed’ using following macro. 
 
#define Working 0
#define Failed 1
#define Freezed 2

There are multiple advantages of using enum over macro when many related named constants have integral values. 
a) Enums follow scope rules. 
b) Enum variables are automatically assigned values. Following is simpler 


CPP

enum state  {Working, Failed, Freezed};
