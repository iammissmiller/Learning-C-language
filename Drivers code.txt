# Code for Explanation 

// C program to demonstrate 
// switch case statement
#include <stdio.h>

// Driver code
int main() {
  int i = 4;
  switch (i) {
    case 1: 
      printf("Case 1\n");break;
    case 2:
      printf("Case 2\n");break;
    case 3:
      printf("Case 3\n");break;
    case 4:
      printf("Case 4\n");break;
    default:
      printf("Default\n");break;

* In programming, the "driver code" refers to the portion of a program designed to initiate and 
  test the functions or operations of the code. It is essentially the code that drives the 
  execution of the main logic.


# Driver Code in the Example
In the provided C program, the driver code is the main function. 
  Here's a brief explanation using the example: 


# Breakdown of Driver Code:

  * Starting Point:

The main function is the entry point of the program. When you run the program,
    execution starts from the main function.

  
  * Variable Initialization:

int i = 4; initializes the variable i with the value 4.

 
  * Switch Statement:

switch (i) { ... } evaluates the value of i and executes the corresponding 
    case block.
In this case, since i is 4, the code within case 4: executes, printing "Case 4" 
    to the console.

  
  * Execution Flow:

The break statement terminates the switch statement, preventing the execution
    of subsequent cases.
If none of the case values matched i, the default case would execute, 
    printing "Default".


  * End of Program:

return 0; indicates that the program executed successfully.


# Summary:
  
  The driver code, which is the main function in this example, sets up the environment 
  (by initializing variables) and directs the flow of execution through the switch statement. 
  This demonstrates how the program behaves based on different values of i. Here, it ensures 
  that when i is 4, the program prints "Case 4".
