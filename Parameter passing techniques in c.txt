In C , there are different ways in which parameter data can be passed into and out of method and function

let us assume function B() is called in function A() b. in this case , A is called the caller and B is called
the called or the callee funtion

Also the arguments which A sends to B are called actual arguements and parameters of B are called the formal arguments

# Terminology

or method call in the calling environment .
