The swap function in your code is designed to swap the values of two integers using pointers. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:

Function Signature:

c
Copy code
void swap(int *x, int *y)
The function takes two parameters: x and y, which are pointers to integers. This allows the function to modify the actual values of x and y in the calling function.
Temporary Variable (t):

c
Copy code
int t;
A temporary variable t is declared to hold one of the values during the swap process. This prevents overwriting one of the values when swapping.
Swapping the Values:

c
Copy code
t = *x;
*x = *y;
*y = t;
t = *x: The value pointed to by x (the value of x in the main function) is stored in t.
*x = *y: The value pointed to by y (the value of y in the main function) is assigned to the memory location pointed to by x, effectively updating x's value.
*y = t: Finally, the value stored in t (which was the original value of x) is assigned to the memory location pointed to by y, completing the swap.
By using pointers, the swap function directly modifies the values of x and y in the main function without needing to return anything.

In summary, the function swaps the values of two variables by manipulating their memory addresses through pointers.
